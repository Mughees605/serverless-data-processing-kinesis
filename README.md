#  Serverless Data Processing on AWS

![Architecture Diagram](images/serverless-kinesis.png?raw=true "Architecture Diagram")

This pattern creates an AWS Kinesis Data Stream, a stream consumer, and an AWS Lambda function. When data is added to the stream, the Lambda function is invoked via a consumer.

Important: this application uses various AWS services and there are costs associated with these services after the Free Tier usage - please see the [AWS Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) for details. You are responsible for any AWS costs incurred. No warranty is implied in this example.

* [Create an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) if you do not already have one and log in. The IAM user that you use must have sufficient permissions to make necessary AWS service calls and manage AWS resources.
* [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) installed and configured
* [Git Installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/intro)
